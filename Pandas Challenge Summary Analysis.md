Pandas Challenge Summary Analysis

Initially we read and combined 2 csv files, one had students' information and the other had school information.
Using this combined file, we were able to create a dataframe with the number of schools, number of students, total budget, test scores and percentage of students that passed the tests
We then started doing some analytics on the data and separated the results by schools, analytics were; per student budget by school, average test scores per school and percentage of students passing tests
Once this information was sorted, we were able to identify the top and bottom 5 performing schools based on passing scores

Additional DataFrames and bins were created to display the test scores by grades, to label each school based on the budget per student and the school size. 

Conclusions:
1. We have 2 small size schools, 5 medium size schools and 8 large schools. The small and medium schools do better in tests than the large schools, but they are less than half of the total schools. This leads us to believe that schools with smaller classrooms and a smaller student to teacher ratio will do better in standardized tests than larger schools. 
2. Due to their size, large schools require a larger budget per student than small or medium size schools, but this larger per student budget does not translate to better test scores.
3. The top 5 schools with highest percetange of students passing both math and reading tests are Charter schools.
